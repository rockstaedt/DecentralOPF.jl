Despite many recent results on the convergence properties of ADMM, a quantitative characterization of the impact of the algorithm parameters on the convergence times of the method is still lacking. In this paper we find the optimal algorithm parameters that minimize the convergence factor of the ADMM iterates in the context of ℓ2-regularized minimization and constrained quadratic programming. Numerical examples show that our parameter selection rules significantly outperform existing alternatives in the literature.},

Experience on applications has shown that the number of iterations depends significantly on the penalty parameter for the system of linear constraint equations. While the penalty parameter is a constant in the original method, in this paper we present a modified alternating direction method that adjusts the penalty parameter per iteration based on the iterate message. Preliminary numerical tests show that the self-adaptive adjustment technique is effective in practice.},

  abstract = {Low-rank representation (LRR) is an effective method for subspace clustering and has found wide applications in computer vision and machine learning. The existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It suffers from \$O(n\^3)\$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover, introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity \$O(rn\^2)\$, where \$r\$ is the rank of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more general convex programs.},

  abstract = {The dynamic economic dispatch problem with energy storage in a smart grid scenario is studied, which aims at minimising the aggregate generation costs over multiple periods on condition that the time-varying demand is met, while physical constraints on generation and storage as well as system spinning reserve requirement are satisfied. In our model, energy storage devices are incorporated for not only inter-temporal energy arbitrage to reduce total generation cost, but also providing spinning reserve to share generators' burden. To solve this problem, we assume that the communication networks are strongly connected directed graphs and propose a fully distributed algorithm based on the ‘consensus-like’ iterative algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our algorithm is distributed in the sense that no leader or master nodes are needed, while all the nodes conduct local computation and communicate merely with their neighbours. Numerical simulation is included to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, making ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.},

Notably, the proposed decentralized formulation of distribution market is derived based on the centralized nodal pricing model that is widely adopted in existing electricity markets. Therefore, under the proposed market, merits of nodal pricing can still be retained and contribute to the enhancement of the operating efficiency of a distribution network. Under some mild conditions on the choice of parameters, convergence of the decentralized algorithm can be guaranteed. Finally, case studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the developed models and algorithms.},
