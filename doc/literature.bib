  abstract = {This paper surveys the literature relevant for comparing centralized and decentralized wholesale electricity markets. Under a centralized design, producers submit detailed cost data to the system operator the day before delivery, who then decides how much to produce for each generation unit. This differs from the decentralized design, which relies on self-commitment, and where producers send less detailed cost information to the system operator. US markets have converged on the centralized design, whereas the trend goes in the other direction in Europe. The paper discusses advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and proposes suggestions for improvement of each design.},

With the continuing search for alternatives to conventional energy sources, it is necessary to include wind energy conversion system (WECS) generators in the ED problem. This paper develops a model to include the WECS in the ED problem, and in addition to the classic economic dispatch factors, factors to account for both overestimation and underestimation of available wind power are included. With the stochastic wind speed characterization based on the Weibull probability density function, the optimization problem is numerically solved for a scenario involving two conventional and two wind-powered generators. Optimal solutions are presented for various values of the input parameters, and these solutions demonstrate that the allocation of system generation capacity may be influenced by multipliers related to the risk of overestimation and to the cost of underestimation of available wind power.},

  abstract = {Low-rank representation (LRR) is an effective method for subspace clustering and has found wide applications in computer vision and machine learning. The existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It suffers from \$O(n\^3)\$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover, introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity \$O(rn\^2)\$, where \$r\$ is the rank of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more general convex programs.},

  abstract = {A timely transition towards a sustainable carbon-neutral power sector requires modern power systems to host increasing numbers of renewable energy sources (RES) and other non-traditional distributed energy sources (DER). However, the stochastic nature and limited controllability of these resources undermines the efficiency of current power system and market operations and creates new forms of physical and financial risks. Modern and future operational paradigms must internalize and mitigate these risks to ensure availability of sustainable electric power at a socially acceptable cost. This dissertation proposes uncertainty- and risk-aware decisionmaking tools for transmission and distribution systems to account for RES and DER stochasticity. The proposed methods leverage mathematically and computationally advantageous properties of a chanceconstrained optimal power flow formulation to internalize statistical uncertainty parameters and predefined risk levels into generator dispatch and reserve decisions. As a result, these decisions are immunized against uncertain RES and DER generation at minimal system cost, while avoiding a sub-optimal over- or underestimation of reserve requirements. Additionally, this dissertation explores datadriven and learning-based modifications of the proposed approaches to ensure robustness against estimation errors of uncertainty parameters. Furthermore, this dissertation shows that convex properties of the proposed chance-constrained framework yield risk-aware price signals that enable an efficient stochastic electricity market design. Specifically, separate energy and reserve prices that capture the expected system state, its inherent uncertainty and the risk acceptance of its participants enable a fully ex-ante settlement of the market. The proposed chance-constrained market design overcomes typical shortcomings of scenario-based stochastic market designs related to computational tractability and per-scenario trade-offs and fulfills desirable market properties for all outcomes of the underlying uncertainty. Additionally, this dissertation demonstrates that the volatility of system state-variables can be controlled in this market via suitable variance metrics and how risk-averse behavior and asymmetric information among market participants can be modeled. The proposed market design and prices are analyzed for distribution (retail) and transmission (wholesale) markets.},

  abstract = {DC power flow is a commonly used tool for contingency analysis. Recently, due to its simplicity and robustness, it also becomes increasingly used for the real-time dispatch and techno-economic analysis of power systems. It is a simplification of a full power flow looking only at active power. Aspects such as voltage support and reactive power management are possible to analyse. However, such simplifications cannot always be justified and sometimes lead to unrealistic results. Especially the implementation of power flow controlling devices is not trivial since standard DC power flow fundamentally neglects their effects. Until recently, this was not an issue as the application of power flow controlling devices in the European grid was limited. However, with the liberalisation of European electricity market and the introduction of large wind energy systems, the need for real power flow control has emerged and therefore, the use of these devices has been reconsidered. Several phase shifting transformers (PST) are being installed or planned in order to control flows. Therefore, it is important to fundamentally re-validate the fast, but less accurate, DC power flow method. In this paper the assumptions of DC power flow are analysed, and its validity is assessed by comparing the results of power flow simulations using both the DC and AC approaches on a modified IEEE 300 bus system with PSTs.},

  abstract = {In modern electricity systems the provision of electricity goes far beyond the mandatory electrical engineering, but instead means providing equivalent reliability and affordability while making the electricity system sustainable. The pathway to a fully decarbonized electricity system requires continuous improvement in market design to accommodate this transformation. Within the European internal energy market for electricity, methods for capacity allocation and congestion management coordinate transmission system operators, power exchanges, generators and consumers for efficient use of transmission infrastructure. As part of the transformation, these methods have to meet high standards defined by the large system size and increasing complexity and dynamic of the generation infrastructure. Flow-based market coupling represents a more dynamic and accurate method for capacity allocation, that is based on network models and forecasted market data, and promises to satisfy the requirements for future electricity markets. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of flow-based market coupling and proposes an open-source electricity market model to facilitate numerical experiments on market design effectiveness. Part I covers the origin of the European internal market for electricity and highlights the main drivers and considerations that lead to the inauguration of flow-based market coupling and the current market structure. The methods used in this thesis and the academic context are introduced and discussed. Part II describes the methods that are developed as part of this thesis to model flow-based market coupling. The proposed open-source power market tool (POMATO) is based on fundamental methods of Operations Research and electrical engineering and provide a transparent and accessible tool for research on electricity markets and flow-based market coupling. Part III includes three applications that enhance the understanding of flow-based market coupling, by evaluating parameter choices and methods, and investigate its efficiency with high shares of intermittent renewable generation. Particularly, the ability of flow-based market coupling to accommodate policy relevant consideration in order to better integrate renewable energy sources in the system are discussed. Flow-based market coupling represents an improvement over static methods for capacity allocation in different ways. The process's ability to implicitly consider all transactions simultaneously based on detailed network and generation forecasts provides measurable improvements to the market design. While the process is inherently more transparent it is also more complex and therefore requires careful parametrization. The applications in this thesis follow a proposed nominal parametrization that in combination with the open-data principles can provide a sustainable basis for future research.},

We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.},

  abstract = {This paper proposed a mathematical framework for establishing a fully decentralized distribution market by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method, where no cooperation between market participants is needed. Notably, the proposed decentralized formulation of distribution market is derived based on the centralized nodal pricing model that is widely adopted in existing electricity markets. Therefore, under the proposed market, merits of nodal pricing can still be retained and contribute to the enhancement of the operating efficiency of a distribution network. Under some mild conditions on the choice of parameters, convergence of the decentralized algorithm can be guaranteed. Finally, case studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the developed models and algorithms.},
